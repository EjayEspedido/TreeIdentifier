You are an expert GIS software developer, environmental planner, and mobile/web application architect.
Your task is to design and implement an interactive map-based application using modern GIS and mapping technologies.

Name of the app: EcoPlan
---

1. Core Application Description

Develop an application that displays an interactive map.
When a user clicks any point on the map, the system must:

1. Identify the nearest barangay based on geographic coordinates.


2. Display barangay information, including:

Barangay name

Population count

Geographic coordinates





---

2. Barangay Data (Static Dataset)

Use the following barangay coordinate and population dataset as the official reference layer:

Barangay coordinates (latitude & longitude)

Barangay population values (provided below)

Distance calculation must use Haversine Formula or equivalent GIS spatial querying


👉 If the clicked point falls within multiple barangay ranges, select the nearest barangay centroid.


---

3. User Input Panel (Side Panel UI)

On the side of the map, provide an input panel where the user can:

Enter land area in square meters

View calculated outputs dynamically



---

4. Tree Planting Computation Logic

After a barangay is selected and land area is entered, the system must:

4.1 Tree Quantity Calculation

Calculate recommended number of trees based on:

Area (square meters)

Standard tree spacing rules (configurable)



4.2 Tree Compatibility & Selection

The app must recommend tree species that are:

Environmentally compatible with the selected location

Native or suitable to Philippine conditions

Appropriate based on:

Urban density

Available planting space

Population pressure




---

5. Environmental & Land-Use Constraints

The system must validate planting feasibility by analyzing:

5.1 Built Environment Detection

Check for:

Buildings

Houses

Roads

Infrastructure


If structures exist, restrict or adjust tree recommendations accordingly


5.2 Flood Risk Assessment

Integrate Project NOAH flood-prone data

If area is flood-prone:

Recommend flood-resilient tree species

Exclude unsuitable trees




---

6. Tree Information Display

For each recommended tree, display:

Tree name

Scientific name (if available)

Image of the tree

Estimated growth timeline:

Seedling stage

Juvenile stage

Mature stage


Environmental benefits (optional but encouraged)


Use the provided tree image and reference links as the official tree database.


---

7. Tree Species Dataset (Preloaded)

Include the following tree species as initial options:

Banaba Tree

Amaltas (Cassia fistula / Golden Shower)

Dungon Tree

Bischofia javanica

Balinghasai

Talisay Tree

Banuyo (Wallaceodendron celebicum)


Each species must contain:

Image

Growth characteristics

Flood tolerance

Urban suitability



---

8. Technical Requirements

Map Engine: Google Maps / Mapbox / Leaflet

Spatial Queries: GIS distance-based calculations

UI: Responsive design with side-panel layout

Architecture: Modular and scalable

Data Handling: Static datasets with future API expansion support



---

9. Output Behavior Summary

When a user:

1. Clicks a location on the map


2. The nearest barangay and its population is displayed


3. The user enters land area (sqm)


4. The system:

Calculates tree quantity

Filters compatible tree species

Checks flood risk & structures

Displays tree images, names, and growth timelines

10. Goal of the Application

To support data-driven environmental planning, urban greening, and sustainable tree-planting decisions based on:

Geographic location

Population density

Environmental constraints

Scientific suitability
